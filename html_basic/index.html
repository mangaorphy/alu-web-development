        <h1>Structure and Elements</h1>
        <p>HTML provides a structured framework for organizing web content. By learning HTML, you'll understand the fundamental elements and tags used to define the structure of a web page. Elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and tables allow you to create well-organized and semantically meaningful content. HTML also enables you to add attributes to elements, such as styling and functionality, to enhance the presentation and interactivity of a web page.
        </p>
        <h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Integration</h2>
        <p>HTML and CSS often go hand in hand. CSS is used to control the visual appearance of HTML elements. By learning HTML, you'll have a solid foundation for integrating CSS styles into your web pages. You'll understand how to apply styles to different HTML elements, create layouts, change colors, fonts, and sizes, and make your web pages visually appealing. The combination of HTML and CSS allows you to separate the structure and presentation of a web page, making it easier to maintain and update.</p>
        <h3>Accessibility and Compatibility</h3>
        <p>
            Learning HTML also involves understanding accessibility and compatibility considerations. HTML provides features and best practices for ensuring web pages are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. By using semantic HTML tags and following accessibility guidelines, you can create web content that is more inclusive and user-friendly. Additionally, HTML is a universal language understood by all web browsers, ensuring compatibility across different platforms and devices. This compatibility is crucial for reaching a wider audience and delivering a consistent user experience.
